Draggable card maps with images, captions, links, connections, admin editor + settings, and frontend shortcode with zoom/pan/fullscreen.

== Description ==

Card Map Builder Pro allows you to create dynamic, interactive maps of cards. It's perfect for visualizing processes, creating simple diagrams, or building unique navigational experiences.

*   **Visual Editor:** Drag and drop cards, create connections, and build your map in a simple and intuitive admin interface.
*   **Customizable Cards:** Add titles, captions, images, and links to each card.
*   **Connections:** Draw lines between cards to show relationships.
*   **Frontend Display:** Use a simple shortcode `[cardmap id="your_map_id"]` to display your map on any page or post.
*   **Pan & Zoom:** Users can pan and zoom the map on the frontend for easy navigation.
*   **Customizable:** Control line colors, styles, hover effects, and more from the settings panel.
*   **Polylang Compatible:** Translate your maps into multiple languages.
