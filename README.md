- **Node Customization:** Add titles, captions, images, and links to each card.
- **Connection Styling:** Customize the color, thickness, and style of the connecting lines.
- **Rails System:** Add horizontal or vertical rails to align nodes neatly.
- **Frontend Rendering:** Display your map on any page or post with the `[cardmap id="..."]` shortcode.
- **Interactive Frontend:** Users can pan and zoom the map for better viewing.
- **Fullscreen Mode:** A dedicated button to view the map in fullscreen.
